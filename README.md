# Climate Change Data Handling and Visualization

This project was developed as part of my final year coursework to understand
how data handling and visualization techniques can be applied to real-world
climate change data using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Description
The main focus of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize climate-related
data in order to observe trends and patterns over time. Basic data preprocessing
and exploratory data analysis techniques are used to make the data suitable
for visualization and interpretation.

## What I Have Done in This Project
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure
- Handled missing and inconsistent data values
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Created visualizations such as line charts and graphs to represent trends
- Interpreted the results obtained from the visual analysis

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains climate-related indicators such as
temperature variations and related measurements.  
(Source can be updated if required.)

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the notebook file using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells in sequence to view the analysis and visualizations
